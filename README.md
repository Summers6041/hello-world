# hello-world

Is there anybody else out there? Phew! For a minute, I thought I was alone.

Now I have your attention, I shall continue...

I am new to programming, so not sure on what I can give back to the GitHub community just yet, but I will be working on small projects to build up my experience and confidence before getting my teeth into something slightly more chewable.

Currently, I know very little in regards to which languages are better than others and each of their uses (or even how many languages there are, come to think of it!). But what I lack in experience I more than make it up with my dedication, commitment and willingness to learn new things.

I'll end it there... no big speech, cheesy cliches, or dramatical endings... Just a simple hello-world, I have arrived!

Hold my hand through this journey and we shall bask in the glory together.
